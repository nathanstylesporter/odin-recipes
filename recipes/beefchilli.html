            <h2><strong><u>Description</u></strong></h2>
                <p>This is my go-to meal when I cannot be bothered to cook. The effort
                    to reward ratio is unmatched as all you need to do is add everything
                    into a pan and stir. You can add onions, garlic or coriander but that 
                    defeats the point of it being a lazy meal.
                </p>

                <p>I'm on a bulk so this provides me with 4 servings of <strong>744 kcal, 35.5g 
                    protein, 25.8g fat and 90.3g carbs.</strong></p>

                <p><em>Total recipe is 2,976 cal, 142g protein, 103g fat, 361.2g carbs so 
                    feel free to distribute that however you like!</em>
                </p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>500g beef mince (20% fat)</li>
                    <li>1 can of chopped tomatoes</li>
                    <li>1 can of kidney bean</li>
                    <li>2 cups of uncooked basmati rice</li>
                    <li>Hot chilli powder</li>
                    <li>Black pepper</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start cooking the rice (It's a lazy recipe I'm gonna assume you have a rice
                        cooker or at least know how to make it in a pot)
                    </li>
                    <li>Open the cans of kidney beans and chopped tomatoes so they are ready
                        to be added immediately when we'll need them later
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the beef mince to a nonstick pan on high heat. I don't add any kind of 
                        cooking oil as the 20% beef mince has enough fat to still make the meal 
                        be juicy. Feel free to add oil if you must.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the hot chilli powder and black pepper to taste. This lazy recipe
                        doesn't have measurements as it's lazy. If it's to spicy then add less
                        next time. If it's not spicy enough then add more next time and eventually
                        you'll be able to eyeball it like I do when I'm lazy.
                    </li>
                    <li>Stir the beef till it goes brown and you can no longer see any pink/red bits.
                    </li>
                    <li>When the beef is browned, add the can off chopped tomatoes and kidney beans</li>
                    <li>Keep the pan on high heat till it starts to bubble then cover and turn to medium
                        heat
                    </li>
                    <li>Let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes. I usually do a taste test and becasue it 
                        is a lazy meal, I don't let it simmer for a long time like other versions of this
                        recipe do. 
                    </li>
                    <li>By now the rice cooker should have finished so serve with the rice and enjoy</li>
                </ol>
